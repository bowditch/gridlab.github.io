Augmented reality is a process of overlaying digitally created content on a user's visor or tablet. &nbsp;An augmented reality visor is semi-translucent and is capable of displaying digital projection.

The applications of Augmented Reality in education, healthcare, entertainment, and business are endless. &nbsp;
