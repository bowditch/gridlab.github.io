Augmented reality is a process of overlaying digitally created content on a user's visor or tablet. &nbsp;An augmented reality visor is semi-translucent and is capable of displaying digital projection.

The applications of Augmented Reality in education, healthcare, entertainment, and business are endless. &nbsp;If you would like more information about the GRID Lab's Augmented Reality capabilities, please contact [John Bowditch](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(98,111,119,100,105,116,99,104,64,111,104,105,111,46,101,100,117)+'?subject=GRID%20Lab%20-%20Augmented%20Reality%20Interest')).
