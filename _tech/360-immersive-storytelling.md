360 degree storytelling at the GRID Lab will take you places you’ve never been before.&nbsp; Using multi-lens camera rigs and cutting edge VR software, we capture environments and characters – stories and points-of-view – in a brand new way.&nbsp; With 360 degree storytelling you become a part of the story.&nbsp; Recent projects include:

* 360 live concert video for Courtney Barnett
* 360 pano-journalism stories for WOUB Public Media
* 360 short film “Re: disappearing” premiered at the Georgetown Film Festival
* 360 coverage of Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail
* 360 training videos of a Level I Trauma Center in action


The IMI produces 360 videos for education, entertainment, news and documentary – each centering around creating environments that immerse the audience. We want to take you places you’ve never been before!
