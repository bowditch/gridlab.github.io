Driven by emerging technology and insights from the science of learning, classrooms are being reconfigured across higher education and at Ohio University. Innovations in learning space design are emerging on our campuses, and the Learning Environments Initiative is intended to bring focus and visibility to this effort.

OHIOâ€™s Classroom Planning Task Force recognizes that learning environments should be designed and sustained to be responsive to the current and future state of education. The task force is creating process, principles, and governance to manage the re-creation of our twenty-first century campuses. They will partner with faculty, students, and vendors to create experimental facilities and explore new classroom models.
