ATHENS, Ohio (June 21, 2017)—Animation Career Review released their [2017 Game Design School Rankings](http://www.animationcareerreview.com/articles/2017-game-design-school-rankings) and Ohio University’s School of Media Arts & Studies’ games & animation program was ranked second in Ohio.

The OHIO program rose from being ranked 13th in 2016 to sixth in the Midwest this year, and went up from 18th to 15th nationally among public schools and colleges with the top 30 percent of schools being considered. It was also ranked 42nd nationally with the top 30 percent of schools being considered.

The School of Media Arts & Studies [bachelor’s degree with a games & animation (G&A)](http://mediaschool.ohio.edu/ga) emphasis encourages students to explore the production of computer animation and digital games while also providing an understanding of the management and leadership roles in these industries. Highlighted courses include digital game design, 3D modeling & animation, visual storytelling, game development, narrative animation, sound for moving images, compositing, and motion graphics.

According to the Animation Career Review website, for the 2017 rankings hundreds of schools in the U.S. that offered programs geared towards animation or game design were considered. [Ranking criteria](http://www.animationcareerreview.com/ranking-criteria) included academic reputation; admission selectivity; depth and breadth of the program; value as it relates to tuition and indebtedness; and geographic location. Individual school surveys and program information were also taken into consideration.

In addition to course offerings, media arts students have access to the Game Research and Immersive Design (GRID) Lab. The GRID Lab, an initiative of Ohio University's Scripps College of Communication, was developed by the School of Media Arts & Studies faculty and staff to provide the Appalachian Ohio region with training, education, and an opportunity to develop technical and creative skills with digital game technology. The GRID Lab serves as an innovative and creative center for undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff research and project development.

The School of Media Arts & Studies also offers a new three-year [MFA degree in Communication Media Arts](http://ouscrippsmfa.com/) where students hone new creative production skills, contextualized through hands-on, collaborative projects in order to graduate prepared for the leading edge of industry. In the program, students select at least two focus areas to study in animation, audio production/sound design, digital games, documentary video/audio, information graphics, interactive media/web design, music production, photojournalism, studio photography, and virtual and augmented reality.
