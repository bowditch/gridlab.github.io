title: A Virtual Reality Experience: Courtney Barnett At NMF ’16
---

June 2, Ohio University’s Immersive Media Initiative (IMI) faculty and students recorded a virtual reality video experience of Australian rocker Courtney Barnett’s 2016 Nelsonville Music Festival set. The Nelsonville Music Festival is a production of Stuart’s Opera House, a non-profit historic theater in Nelsonville, Ohio.

The resulting videos are unveiled today as a part of a partnership between the Nelsonville Music Festival, the Scripps College of Communication, the Ohio University GRID Lab and WOUB Public Media.

The recordings feature tracks from Barnett’s critically acclaimed 2014 album Sometimes I Sit and Think and Sometimes I Just Sit, recorded with cutting edge equipment purchased with funds from a major Innovation Grant awarded to the IMI earlier this year for the development of virtual and augmented reality projects. Barnett was nominated for a Best New Artist Grammy in 2015 and headlined night one of the Nelsonville Music Festival shortly after her performance on the season finale of Saturday Night Live.
