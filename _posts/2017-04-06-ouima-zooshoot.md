ATHENS, Ohio (April 6, 2017)—On March 14, a team of students from Ohio University’s Immersive Media Association (OUIMA) and the Immersive Media Initiative (IMI) traveled to Columbus to shoot a 360° video under and above water at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. The students wanted to focus their video on the aquarium, and after some planning with the zoo’s team, they set a shoot date and began to decide what cameras and rigs they would use.

The initial idea for the shoot came from three students, James Edelstein, Iggy Cossman and Aaron Dimanna. They proposed the question, “What does it look like on the other side of the glass?”

“Our main goal was, we wanted to create something in partnership with the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium that would benefit both parties,” said Edelstein. “We wanted to offer a perspective that very few people get to experience. We want this footage to encourage people to go see these wonderful animals in person.”

The team focused their shoot on the Manatee Coast and aquarium attractions. But, before they headed to Columbus, the team needed to figure out a few logistical problems. The Columbus Zoo had some restrictions on how the team could shoot the video. The team wanted to shoot both above and below water, so many of the challenges came from trying to shoot all the desired content while still abiding by the rules that were laid out for them.

“We actually came up with some funny looking, Frankenstein rigs before we settled on the final one. Once we got to the aquarium on shoot day, everything just worked really well,” said Edelstein, one of the directors of the project.

The team is now putting together the final video piece which may be used in promotional videos for the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. They’re hoping that if the zoo likes the video, the partnership may continue in the future.

The OUIMA explores state-of-the-art technologies such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, 360 Video Production, Motion Capture, and Light field Cameras, just to name a few. OUIMA meets on Sundays from 3-5 p.m. in the GRID Lab located in Scripps Hall.
