The Game Research and Immersive Design (GRID) Lab, an initiative of Ohio University’s Scripps College of Communication, was developed by faculty and staff to provide the Appalachian Ohio region with training, education, and an opportunity to develop technical and creative skills with digital game technology. The GRID Lab serves as an innovative and creative center for undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff research and project development.

The GRID Lab’s research laboratory opened in September 2005 made possible through a grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission and other university and community partners. Since 2005, the GRID Lab has been awarded numerous grants and contracts from state and federal agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, Central Ohio Urban Area Security Initiative, the Ohio Board of Regents, Department of Energy, Department of Labor, and the National Institutes of Health. Most recently, our Immersive Media Initiative was funded through the Ohio University Innovation Strategy. &nbsp;Please see our Research section of the website for details on past, current, and future projects.

The focus of the Lab is the research and development of Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed reality experience and technology, serious and educational games, simulations, computer animation, and Motion Capture. The GRID Lab provides Ohio University with the personnel, facilities, and tools to create such interactive digital media and technologies.

The GRID Lab is proud to collaborate with the following regional partners: Ohio University’s Innovation Center, TechGROWTH Ohio, the Online Journal for Space Communication, The SunSat Design Competition, the Ohio Game Developer's Association, the Ohio University Center for Entrepreneurship, and Ohio University’s Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs
